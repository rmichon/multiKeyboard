For now, the examples of this architecture are in this folder but they should be moved to the examples folder eventualy. We're waiting until the new libraries will be pushed to the master branch before doing that... Also, all the examples in this folder use the new library system so trying to compile them with the current version of Faust will probably not work. The new Faust lib collection can be downloaded here: https://github.com/rmichon/faustLib
